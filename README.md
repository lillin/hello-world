# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello everybody! I am Lina and I am only beginner (but not quite already) in programming (and in English too, ha-ha), but strong in drawing and painting. Someday I become a python architect :-B

This is the biggest one from my wishes.

But for nowadays my major goal is getting my first job as a junior.

Sorry for grammar mistakes. I am strong in reading but not in writing :-D
